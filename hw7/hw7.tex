\hproblem Problem 3-14

Show that real projective space $\mathbb{P}^n$ is an $n$-manifold.
[Hint: consider the subsets $U_i \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ where $x_i= 1$.]

\solution
Let $V_i\subseteq \RR^{n+1}$ be $V_i=\{x\in\RR^{n+1}:x_i= 1\}$.

\textbf{Lemma:} \textit{The set $V_i$ is homeomorphic to $\RR^n$}\\
Define $i:V_i\ra\RR^n$ by $i(x_1,...,x_{n+1})=(x_1,...,\hat{x_i},...,x_{n+1})$,
where $x_i$ is omitted, and $x_i=1$ because $x\in V_i$.
Clearly $i$ is bijective and continuous, since each coordinate function is continuous.

Also, $i^{-1}$ is the map
$i^{-1}:(x_1,...,x_n)=(x_1,...,1,...,x_{n+1})$, where there is a 1
inserted
in slot $i$.  Each component function is continuous so it is
continuous and hence $i$ is a homeomorphism.\hfill$\Box$

We will denote the quotient map from $\RR^{n+1}$ to $\PP^n$ by $q$.

Let $U_i\subseteq \RR^{n+1}$ be $U_i=\{x\in\RR^{n+1}:x_i\ne 0\}$.\\

Define $\phi_i:U_i\ra V_i$ be the map
$\phi_i(x)=\frac{1}{x_i}(x_1,...,x_{n+1})$.

Then $\phi_i$ is constant on the fibers of $\PP^n$, because if
$x\sim y$ then $x_k=\lambda y_k$ for $1\le k \le n+1$, and:
$$ \phi_i(x)=\frac{1}{x_i}(x_1,...,x_{n+1})=
\frac{1}{\lambda y_i}(\lambda y_1,...,\lambda y_{n+1}) =
\frac{1}{y_i}(y_1,...,y_{n+1})=\phi_i(y). $$
Also observe that $\phi_i$ is continuous, in class we discussed that the map
``scalar multiplication'' is continuous.

So, in the diagram

\centerline{
\xymatrix{
U_i \ar[d]_{q} \ar[dr]^{\phi_i} &  \\
\PP^n \ar[r]_{\tilde\phi_i} & V_i  }}

the function $\tilde\phi_i$ exists, and furthermore it is continuous
since $\phi_i$ is continuous and $q$ is a quotient map.

Next consider this diagram

\centerline{
\xymatrix{
V_i \ar@{^{(}->}[r]^{i} \ar[dr]_{\tilde\psi_i} & \RR^n \ar[d]^{q}  \\
 & \PP^n  }}

The topological embedding from $V_i$ to $\RR^n$ is continuous from the
Lemma, and $q$ is a quotient map, hence $\tilde\psi_i$ is continuous.

Note that $\phi_i(x)=x$ if $x\in V_i$, and that $i(x)=x$ is the identity
map when $x\in V_i$.
Then $\tilde\phi_i^{-1}=\psi_i$, because
\begin{align*}
x\in V_i:\quad \tilde\phi_i(\tilde\psi_i(x)) &= \tilde\phi_i(q(i(x)))=\phi_i(i(x))=\phi_i(x)=x.\\
x\in\PP^n:\quad \tilde\psi_i(\tilde\phi_i(x)) &= q(i(\tilde\phi_i(x)))=q(\tilde\phi_i(x))=\phi_i(x)=x.
\end{align*}

Thus $\tilde\phi_i$ is a bijection from $\PP^n$ to $V_i$ and hence a homeomorphism.
In the Lemma we showed that $V_i$ is homeomorphic to $\RR^n$, so
$\PP^n$ is homeomorphic to $\RR^n$

The functions $\tilde\phi_i$ define charts on $\PP^n$ to $V_i$.  Observe that
every $x\in\PP^n$ is in the domain of at least one chart.  Hence $\PP^n$
is locally Euclidean.

$\PP^n$ is then second countable because $U_i$ is second countable.  Further,
$\PP^n$ is Hausdorff hence $\PP^n$ is an $n$ dimensional manifold.

\hproblem Problem 3-16

Let $X$ be the subset
$(\mathbb{R}\times\{0\})\cup(\mathbb{R}\times\{1\})\subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$.
Define an equivalence relation on $X$ by declaring $(x,0)\sim (x,1)$ if $x\neq 0$.
Show that the quotient space $X/\sim$ is locally Euclidean and second countable,
but not Hausdorff. (This space is called the line with two origins.)

Your solution should not be longer than a page.
Extra credit for the shortest correct solution.

\solution
Denote the quotient map by $q$ and
define the sets $X_0=X\setminus\{(0,1)\}$ and $X_1=X\setminus\{(0,0)\}$,
and the maps
\begin{align*}
\phi_0:X_0\ra\RR \text{ by } \phi_0(x,a) &= x  \\
\phi_1:X_1\ra\RR \text{ by } \phi_1(x,a) &= x.
\end{align*}
Each of $\phi_i$ is a projection and hence continuous.  The sets $X_0$
and $X_1$ are both open in $X$ as removing a single point results in
an open set.

Claim: $\phi_i$ is constant on the fibers of $q$. To see this,
let $q(x,a)=q(y,b)$, where $(x,a)$ and $(y,b)\in X_i$.
Then, we must have $x=y$, and hence $\phi_i(x)=\phi_i(y)$.
Thus, in the diagram

\centerline{
\xymatrix{
X_i \ar[d]_{q} \ar[dr]^{\phi_i} &  \\
X/\sim \ar[r]_{\tilde\phi_i} & \RR  }}

the map $\tilde\phi_i$ exists, and it is continuous.  In fact we can write
$\tilde\phi_i([x])=x$, and evidently $\tilde\phi_i$ is bijective.

Now consider the diagram

\centerline{
\xymatrix{
\RR \ar[r]^{f_i} \ar[dr]_{\tilde\psi_i} & X_i \ar[d]^{q}  \\
 & X/\sim  }}

Where the map $f_i:\RR\ra X_i$ is $f_i(x)=(x,i)$.  Note that $(x,i)\in X_i$,
and that $f_i$ is continuous because each component is.  Then by
the characteristic property, $\tilde\psi_i$ is continuous.
Moreover,
$\tilde\psi_i=\tilde\phi_i^{-1}$ because
\begin{align*}
\tilde\phi_i(\tilde\psi_i(x)) &= \tilde\phi_i(q(f_i(x))) =
                                 \phi_i(f_i(x)) = \phi_i(x,i) = x\\
\tilde\psi_i(\tilde\phi_i([x])) &= q(f_i(\tilde\phi_i([x]))) =
                                 q(f_i(x)) = q(x,i) = [x].
\end{align*}
Therefore $\tilde\phi_i$ is a homeomorphism.  Hence the pair $\tilde\phi_i$
are two charts on $X/\sim$ and therefore $X/\sim$ is locally
Euclidean.
Then because $X$ is second countable, $X/\sim$ is second countable.

Finally, $X/\sim$ is not Hausdorff.  To see this,
let $U_i=(a_i,b_i)\times\{i\}$ be basic open neighborhoods of
$(0,i)\in X$, for $i=0,1$.  Take any $(x,0)\in U_0$, and WLOG suppose $x>0$,
so $0<x<b_0$.  If $(x,1)\in U_1$ we are done, so suppose $(x,1)\not\in U_1$.
Then $0<b_1<x$, and choose $c$ such that $0<c<b_1$.
But then $0<c<b_0$, so $(c,0)\in U_0$ and $(c,1)\in U_1$, so
$q(U_0)\cap q(U_1)\ne\emptyset$.

\hproblem Exercise 4.4

Prove that a topological space $X$ is disconnected if and only if there exists a
nonconstant continuous function from $X$ to the discrete space $\{0,1\}$.

\solution
($\implies$):\\
Suppose $X$ is disconnected.  Then there exist disjoint open sets $U,V$ in $X$ where
$U$ and $V$ are nonempty, are not $X$, and with $U\cup V=X$.

Define $f:X\ra \{0,1\}$ by $f(U)=0$ and $f(V)=1$.  Since $U$ and $V$ are both
nonempty, $f$ is not constant.

There are only 4 open sets in $\{0,1\}$, and the preimage of all of them is
open:
$$ f^{-1}(\{0\})=U,\quad f^{-1}(\{1\})=V,\quad f^{-1}(\{0,1\})=X,\quad f^{-1}(\emptyset)=\emptyset. $$
So $f$ is continuous.

($\impliedby$):\\
The contrapositive of the reverse implication can be interpreted as:
If $X$ is connected, then any continuous function from $X$ to $\{0,1\}$ must
be constant.  But this is precisely Proposition 4.2 in the text.

\hproblem Problem 4-9 (Just the manifold part)

Show that every $n$-manifold is homeomorphic to a disjoint union of countably
many connected $n$-manifolds.

\solution
Let $M$ be an $n$-manifold.  Let $\{C_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in I}$
be the connected components of
$M$.  Since $M$ is a disjoint union of $\{C_\alpha\}$, each $C_\alpha$ is
open by the previous excercise.  Any open subset of an $n$-manifold is itself
an $n$-manifold, hence each $C_\alpha$ is an $n$-manifold.

Manifolds are second countable, hence $M$ has a countable basis.  Let $\calB$ be
a countable basis for $M$.  Choose any $x_\alpha$ in each $C_\alpha$.  Then
there is a $B_\alpha\in\calB$ with $x_\alpha\in B_\alpha\subseteq C_\alpha$,
for each $\alpha\in I$.

Define the function $f:I\ra I$ by $f(\alpha)=\beta$ where 
$\beta$ is the $\beta$ for which $B_\beta\subseteq C_\alpha$.  Clearly
$f$ is surjective, as there is a $B_\beta$ for each $C_\alpha$.

For any $\alpha_1,\alpha_2 \in I$, where $\alpha_1\ne\alpha_2$,
we have $C_{\alpha_1} \cap C_{\alpha_2} = \emptyset$ hence
$B_{f(\alpha_1)} \cap B_{f(\alpha_2)} = \emptyset$ too,
and so $B_{f(\alpha_1)} \ne B_{f(\alpha_2)}$.
Thus $f$ is injective, and hence we have a bijection between a
subset of $\calB$ and 
$\{C_\alpha\}$.  Since $\calB$ is countable, $\{C_\alpha\}$
must be as well.
